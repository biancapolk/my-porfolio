                <p>My career background is in Technical Project Management but I’ve always had a passion for technology and it’s that passion that led me to pursue and earn my Computer Science degree.
                    Seeking a position in Software Development, specifically backend engineering in Java, Python, JavaScript or a related language.
                    I love API’s and enjoy working on teams! More than anything, I’m looking to embed myself with a team of talented developers and learn from the ground up.
                    I am very excited about this new direction in my career and look forward to speaking with you!
